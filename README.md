# Twitter-PlanB

So as you may or may not know Twitter was bought by Elon Musk, it was assumed things would take a few weeks or months to shake out. In the first week, he fired several top execs including the one responsible for safety, and content moderation on the platform. It's now (2022-11-04) one-week after, and Elon Musk has just fired roughly half of Twitter's global workforce including several entire teams. Elon Musk has also stated that Twitter needs to find 1 Billion per year in infrastructure savings, which is sadly possible if Twitter gets rid of extra capacity needed to service big events like national elections or natural disasters.

In other words, Twitter went from boring to highly risky. You can start dealing with this risk now, or leave it until you MUST deal with it. At the rate things have gone in the first week I'm not sure how much time we have.

# Alternatives to Twitter

There are alternative social networks, but none fall into the unique category of micro-blogging/commenting/replies that Twitter occupies. Because Twitter is primarily text-based (with support for images and video) the cost and speed to create high-quality content are very low, and people with small follower counts have posted polls and memes that do incredibly well (tens of thousands to millions of interactions). 

Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, and so on are primarily video and image focussed and do not generally drive the types of conversations and interactions that happen on Twitter. Platforms like Signal, WeChat, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and so on are primarily focused on the real-time conversation for smaller groups of people, and have scaling issues (not just technologically but from a human interface point of view). The legacy platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook are what they are, and if they were a realistic alternative to Twitter, why did you leave them for Twitter in the first place?

# So what do we replace Twitter with?

The only real alternative to Twitter is Mastodon, and/or staying on Twitter. I suspect many content publishers will stay on Twitter, to quote several "Twitter is huge, it drives engagement, and it is critical for my/our brand", but fortunately there is nothing to stop people or organizations from posting all their content to both Twitter and Mastodon.

# What is Mastodon

> Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. It has microblogging features similar to the Twitter service, which are offered by a large number of independently run Mastodon nodes (technically known as instances), each with its own code of conduct, terms of service, privacy options, and moderation policies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)

# Users of Twitter

Before we get into using Mastodon, I also wanted to cover some of the problems/concerns of the various types of Twitter users.

## Regular users

A lot of people like Twitter because it lets them follow some people and read their content quickly. If the people you follow the move to Mastodon and you want to consume their content, you'll need to set up a Mastodon account and follow these people. You'll need to get used to a slightly different interface, but other than that not a lot will change. Oh, there won't be any ads, so that's nice.

## Journalists / Researchers

Many journalists and researchers use Twitter to keep an eye on things, contact people, get quotes, to ask questions, and so on. I heavily rely on Twitter for new InfoSec happenings, a great example being the timeline I did for #log4shell which includes a couple of tweets that were days in advance of the issue officially going public, had we paid attention then...

One major challenge faced by journalists on Twitter (and in general on social media platforms) is reaching out to people for quotes/questions and making sure you have the correct person. It's well known that "Fake" accounts with real names exist and would happily troll journalists. So establishing that the person you are talking to is indeed the correct person is a real challenge for these users, especially when they are on a deadline.

## People and organizations with followers

Many people and organizations use Twitter to engage with their public fans, publish information, and so on. The Cloud Security Alliance is a good example of this, our account (@cloudsa) has 17k+ followers, and virtually everything it tweets is just information about new papers, working groups, and other Cloud Security Alliance activities. This Twitter account is vital as part of the engagement funnel that brings people and organizations into the Cloud Security Alliance and gets the word out about our new work.


## Advertisers on Twitter

Advertising on Mastodon isn't really a thing, you'll need to contact people directly to do sponsorships or similar things.
